        <h1>Importance of Donating Surplus Food</h1>
        <p class="importance">Donating surplus food at a cheaper price is crucial for addressing food insecurity and fostering equity.</p>
        <p>We offer to solve this problem by creating the app Nourish, offering surplus food at reduced costs. This help those in need to have more accessible to qaulity foods to help individuals and families facing financial hardship. This ensures nutritious food reaches those in need while alleviating financial burdens.</p>
        <p>Moreover, such initiatives promote environmental sustainability by reducing food waste. They also foster social cohesion and empathy within communities, contributing to a more inclusive society.</p>
        <p class="highlight">Our front-end system demonstrates the accessibility and positive impact of donating surplus food, encouraging users to engage and contribute to positive social change.</p>
